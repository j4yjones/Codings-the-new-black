        <h3> We believe we can all make a difference </h3>
        <p> The tech community is growing every day: not only are 20% of global workforce are working in technology, thousands of students are studying specific programs to pursue a career, and millions more who are learning as an interest.
            Programming is a scientific discipline at a basic level, but is an art form at a more sublime level, it's similar to cooking; a chef will follow a recipe, and each type of dish requires certain ingredients, and the end result is subjective and contains a little bit of your personality. </p>
